## **Why Hackathons Matter**  
**Hackathons arenâ€™t just about codingâ€”theyâ€™re about problem-solving.**  
*Theyâ€™re about bringing ideas to life in 24 hours (or less) when time is your greatest constraint.*  

This event is a microcosm of how innovation happens in the real world:  
- **Rapid iteration:** Test, fail, improve.  
- **Cross-disciplinary teams:** Designers, engineers, and marketers unite.  
- **Real-world impact:** Solving challenges that matter.  

**Remember:** The best solutions often come from thinking *differently*.
