# Simple Interest Calculator in Python

This is a basic Python program to calculate simple interest using the formula:  
**Simple Interest = (Principal Ã— Rate Ã— Time) / 100**

---

## Code Implementation

```python
# Get input from the user
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): "))
time = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))

# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# Display the result
print(f"**Simple Interest:** ${simple_interest:.2f}")  # Formatted to 2 decimal places
```

---

## How It Works
- **Principal**: The initial amount of money (e.g., $1000).
- **Rate**: The annual interest rate (e.g., 5 for 5%).
- **Time**: The number of years the money is invested/borrowed (e.g., 3).
- The formula computes the total interest earned or paid over the given period.

## Example Output
```
Enter the principal amount: 5000
Enter the annual interest rate (in %): 4.5
Enter the time in years: 2
**Simple Interest:** $450.00
```
